- 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua Taylor
- 👀 I’m interested in learning web development and applying those skills to creating web apps. I come from a background in electrical engineering in the building design and construction industry where I designed electrical power systems for hospitals, telecommunications buildings, data centers, pharmaceutrical production and research facilities, along with many others. I want to apply what I know about the electrical engineering world to web development through the creation of tools and calculators.
